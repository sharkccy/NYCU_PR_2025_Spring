## Introduction:

- This project implements two kinds of classifiers, which are Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB) classifier and Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) classifier, 

  and observing their performance on four datasets. Two of them are two-class classification task and the others are multi-class classification tasks.

- Dimensionality reduction techniques, including FLD, PCA, and Feature Selection, are applied to see how they affect the performance of classifiers.

- See the `110612117_HW2.pdf` file to see further discussion.
